### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is AdriÃ  Mitjavila Ventura, a biotechnologist living around computers.

Currently, I work at the [Institut Josep Carreras (IJC)](https://www.carrerasresearch.org/en/) in the Regulatory Genomics group. Previously, I was a bioinformatician working in Epigenetics at the [Istituto Europeo di Oncologia (IEO)](https://www.research.ieo.it/).

I am interested in the (computational) study of small RNAs and the mechanisms of gene regulation in animals. I am also attracted for omics data analysis to support experimental research, and I am eager to learn a bit of programming, specially in R and Python.

If you use one of my repositories, please cite it and give me a star.

See more about me in [my personal website](https://amitjavilaventura.github.io).

Take a look at my CV [here](https://amitjavilaventura.github.io/CVs/).
