### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is AdriÃ  Mitjavila, a biotechnologist living around computers and seeking for a PhD student in Computational Biology. 

I am currently working in an Epigenetics group, focussing my effots in omics analyses in support to experimental research and in mainly computational projects related to the goals of the group. I am looking forward to learn some programming, specially in R and Pyhton.

Apart from science, I love scientific divulgation -I have recently created a blog focussed to spreading bioinformatics to society named [BioBit](https://biobit.netlify.app)- and practicing sport, specially rowing -sport in which I competed at international level-.

See more about me in [my personal website](https://amitjavilaventura.github.io).
