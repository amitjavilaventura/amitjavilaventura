### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is AdriÃ  Mitjavila Ventura, a biotechnologist living around computers.

Currently, I work at the [Institut Josep Carreras (IJC)](https://www.carrerasresearch.org/en/) in the Regulatory Genomics group. Previously, I was a bioinformatician working in Epigenetics at the [Istituto Europeo di Oncologia (IEO)](https://www.research.ieo.it/).

I am interested in the study of small RNAs and in omics data analysis to support experimental research. Moreover, I am eager to learn a bit of programming, specially in R and Python.

Apart from science, I love scientific divulgation -I have recently created a blog named [BioBit](https://biobit.netlify.app) focussed spreading bioinformatics to society- and practicing sport, specially rowing -sport in which I competed at international level-.

If you use one of my repositories, please cite me and give me a star.

See more about me in [my personal website](https://amitjavilaventura.github.io).

Take a look at my CV [here](https://amitjavilaventura.github.io/CVs/).
